The FBLA Mobile Application Development competition for this year focuses on designing a mobile application that gamifies learning in subjects like math, science, history, and language arts through interactive quizzes, puzzles, and progress tracking.

FlashMaster directly aligns with this theme by providing:

Gamified Flashcard Learning: Users can create flashcard decks for any subject and use them to reinforce their knowledge.
Interactive Design: Users engage with flashcards dynamically, allowing them to build, review, and share their decks with others.
Educational Content Creation: The app supports customized learning by enabling users to add their own flashcards tailored to their study needs.
Progress Tracking: Users can organize flashcards by topics, ensuring structured learning.
User Feedback Mechanisms: The ability to create, edit, and share decks provides users with an interactive way to reinforce knowledge.
With a user-friendly interface and Firebase integration, FlashMaster transforms the traditional study method into a collaborative, engaging, and gamified experience.
